### Hi there, I’m **Brian Pondi** — Geospatial Researcher & Software Engineer

I’m a **Computational Geographer** specializing in the design and development of **geospatial machine-learning (ML) backend systems** that create real-world impact. My work sits at the intersection of **Earth Observation, scalable data infrastructures, and reproducible ML workflows**.

Currently, I’m a **Researcher at the Institute for Geoinformatics (IfGI), University of Münster, Germany**, working on the EU-funded **[Open Earth Monitor Cyberinfrastructure](https://earthmonitor.org/)** project. In parallel, I’m pursuing a **PhD in Geoinformatics**, focusing on **machine-learning reproducibility and interoperability for Earth Observation data cubes**, under the advisement of **[Prof. Edzer Pebesma](https://github.com/edzer)**.

**Research interests & skills include:**
- 🌍 Earth Observation & Data Cubes  
- 🤖 Geospatial Machine Learning & AI  
- 🧩 Reproducible & Interoperable ML workflows  
- 🗺️ Spatial data infrastructures & cloud-native geospatial systems  
- ⚙️ Backend engineering for geospatial applications  

I’m always open to **collaborations, research discussions, and new challenges**—feel free to reach out! 😊
