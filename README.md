### Hi buddy, I'm Brian Pondi: The GeoGeek 🌍 😎.

### I'm a Geospatial Researcher and a Software Engineer!
A Computational Geographer focused on building Geospatial Machine Learning(ML) backend software systems that positively impact our daily lives. Currently, I am a Researcher at the Institute for Geoinformatics in Münster Germany on 2 EU-funded projects i.e. [Open Earth Monitor Cyberinfrastructure](https://earthmonitor.org/) and [interTwin](https://www.intertwin.eu/). Additionally, I am pursuing my doctoral degree in Geoinformatics under the advisory of [Edzer Pebesma](https://github.com/edzer).

Always open to discussing new opportunities and challenges for collaboration, so feel free to contact me 🙂.
